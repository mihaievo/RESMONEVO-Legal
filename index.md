### End User License Agreement

```markdown
This End-User License Agreement ("EULA") is a legal agreement between you and Mihai EVO.

This EULA agreement governs your acquisition and use of our RESMONEVO software ("Software") directly from Mihai EVO or indirectly through a Mihai EVO authorized reseller or distributor (a "Reseller").

Please read this EULA agreement carefully before completing the installation process and using the RESMONEVO software. It provides a license to use the RESMONEVO software and contains warranty information and liability disclaimers.

If you register for a free trial of the RESMONEVO software, this EULA agreement will also govern that trial. By clicking "accept" or installing and/or using the RESMONEVO software, you are confirming your acceptance of the Software and agreeing to become bound by the terms of this EULA agreement.

If you are entering into this EULA agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity and its affiliates to these terms and conditions. If you do not have such authority or if you do not agree with the terms and conditions of this EULA agreement, do not install or use the Software, and you must not accept this EULA agreement.

This EULA agreement shall apply only to the Software supplied by Mihai EVO herewith regardless of whether other software is referred to or described herein. The terms also apply to any Mihai EVO updates, supplements, Internet-based services, and support services for the Software, unless other terms accompany those items on delivery. If so, those terms apply.

==========
License Grant
==========

Mihai EVO hereby grants you a personal, non-transferable, non-exclusive licence to use the RESMONEVO software on your devices in accordance with the terms of this EULA agreement.

You are permitted to load the RESMONEVO software (for example a PC) under your control. You are responsible for ensuring your device meets the minimum requirements of the RESMONEVO software.

The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives you some rights to use the software. RESMONEVO reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement. In doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways.

You are not permitted to:
• Edit, alter, modify, adapt, translate or otherwise change the whole or any part of the Software nor permit the whole or any part of the Software to be combined with or become incorporated in any other software, nor decompile, disassemble or reverse engineer the Software or attempt to do any such things.
• Reproduce, copy, distribute, resell or otherwise use the Software for any commercial purpose.
• Allow any third party to use the Software on behalf of or for the benefit of any third party.
• Use the Software in any way which breaches any applicable local, national or international law.
• Use the Software for any purpose that Mihai EVO considers is a breach of this EULA agreement.

=========================
Intellectual Property and Ownership
=========================

Mihai EVO shall at all times retain ownership of the Software as originally downloaded by you and all subsequent downloads of the Software by you. The Software (and the copyright, and other intellectual property rights of whatever nature in the Software, including any modifications made thereto) are and shall remain the property of Mihai EVO.

Mihai EVO reserves the right to grant licences to use the Software to third parties.

======
Support
======

Because this software is "as is," we may or not provide support services for it.

=========
Termination
=========

This EULA agreement is effective from the date you first use the Software and shall continue until terminated. You may terminate it at any time upon written notice to Mihai EVO.

It will also terminate immediately if you fail to comply with any term of this EULA agreement. Upon such termination, the licenses granted by this EULA agreement will immediately terminate and you agree to stop all access and use of the Software. The provisions that by their nature continue and survive will survive any termination of this EULA agreement.

=====================================
Limitation on and Exclusion of Remedies and Damages
=====================================

You cannot recover from RESMONEVO and its suppliers direct damages caused by negelction, ignoration or unintended use of the product. You cannot recover any other damages, including consequential, lost profits, special, indirect or incidental damages.

This limitation applies to:
• anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party programs;
• claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.
It also applies even if RESMONEVO knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.

==========
Governing Law
==========

This EULA agreement, and any dispute arising out of or in connection with this EULA agreement, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Romania. If you acquired the software in Romania, state law governs the interpretation of this agreement and applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws principles. The laws of the state where you live govern all other claims, including claims under state consumer protection laws, unfair competition laws, and in tort.
Outside Romania: if you acquired the software in any other country, the laws of that country apply.
